Training a MLP model with images generated by a GAN. <br>
Utils.py file is given by [Diego](/https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalejogm/) to help visualize the training. <br>
Numbers like 1, 4 and 7 appeared less frequently than the others, a new generator was created, just for those missing digits. <br>
